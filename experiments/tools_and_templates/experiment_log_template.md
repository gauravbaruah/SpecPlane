# Experiment 1: Source of Truth Approach
**Date**: [Date]
**Duration**: [Start time] - [End time] ([Total minutes])
**Components Attempted**: [List]

## What Worked Well
- [List things that worked well]
- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]

## What Needed Manual Intervention  
- [List things you had to fix/clarify]
- [Issue 1 and how you fixed it]
- [Issue 2 and how you fixed it]

## Cursor Behavior
- How well did Cursor understand the prompt?
- How many clarifications did you need to give?
- What code quality did it produce?

## Cursor's First Response
- What files did it create?
- What structure did it assume?
- What questions did it ask?

## Cursor Assumptions
- [What did Cursor assume about the requirements?]
- [How did it handle error cases?]
- [What file structure did it create?]

## Files Generated
- [List of files Cursor created]


## Final Assessment
- **Success**: ✅/❌ Did you get working components?
- **Quality**: [1-5] How good was the generated code?
- **Efficiency**: [1-5] How much manual work was needed?
- **Completeness**: [1-5] How much of the functionality got built?
- **Usability**: [1-5] Could you actually use this component?

## Next Steps
- [What would you do differently?]
- [What to test in next experiment?]
