observability:
  monitoring:
    metrics:
      - "YAML parsing success rate and timing"
      - "Validation error rates and types"
      - "File size distribution and parsing performance"
      - "Memory usage during large file processing"

    traces:
      - "YAML parsing pipeline execution"
      - "Validation rule application and results"
      - "Error reporting and context generation"
  
  alerting:
    critical:
      - "High parsing failure rates (>5%)"
      - "Memory usage exceeding limits during parsing"
      - "Schema validation system failures"
    
    warning:
      - "Slow parsing performance (>1s per file)"
      - "High validation warning rates"
      - "Large file processing delays"
  
  slis:
    - "YAML parsing success rate: 98%"
    - "Average parsing time: <500ms per file"
  
  slos:
    - "Single file parsing completes within 500ms"
    - "Validation of 100 files completes within 2 minutes"
    - "Memory usage stays under 50MB during operations"

validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "YAML files are successfully parsed into JavaScript objects"
    - "Parsed content is validated against SpecPlane schema requirements"
    - "Detailed error messages include file location and line numbers"
    - "Validation warnings are generated for non-critical issues"
    - "Schema compliance is accurately reported"
    - "Performance meets specified timing requirements"
    - "Memory usage stays within defined limits"
  
  edge_cases:
    - "YAML files with complex nested structures and circular references"
    - "Files with missing required fields or invalid data types"
    - "Very large files (>10MB) with extensive content"
    - "Files with special characters or non-UTF-8 encoding"
    - "YAML files with syntax errors or malformed structure"
    - "Files with embedded binary content or large text blocks"
  
  assumptions:
    - "Input YAML content is text-based and parseable"
    - "SpecPlane schema requirements are well-defined and stable"
    - "File system has sufficient memory for parsing operations"
    - "YAML content follows YAML 1.2 specification"
  
  readiness: "draft"
  open_questions:
    - "Should we implement incremental validation for very large files?"
    - "How should we handle custom YAML tags and extensions?"
    - "What level of schema versioning should we support?"
    - "Should we implement caching for frequently parsed schemas?"
