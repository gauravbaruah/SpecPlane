validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Markdown output follows specified section order and structure"
    - "Meta section appears first with all key information"
    - "Relationship diagrams are properly embedded as Mermaid code blocks"
    - "All sections maintain proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)"
