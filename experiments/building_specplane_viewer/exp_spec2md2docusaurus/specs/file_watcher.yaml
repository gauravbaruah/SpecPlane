observability:
  monitoring:
    metrics:

  alerting:
    critical:
      - "File watching system failures"
      - "High change detection latency (>1s)"
      - "Memory usage exceeding limits"
      - "Permission errors preventing watching"
    
    warning:
      - "Slow change detection (>500ms)"
      - "High number of files being watched (>1000)"
      - "Frequent file system errors"
  
  slis:
    - "File change detection latency: <500ms"
    - "Watch system availability: 99%"
    - "Change event processing success rate: 98%"
  
  slos:
    - "File changes detected within 500ms"
    - "Watch system handles 1000+ files without degradation"
    - "Memory usage stays under 20MB during operation"

validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Directory watching starts successfully for valid paths"
    - "YAML file changes are detected within specified latency"
    - "File additions, modifications, and deletions are properly tracked"
    - "Conversion processes are triggered for changed files"
    - "Watch patterns and exclusions are properly applied"
    - "Error handling provides clear feedback for issues"
    - "Performance remains stable with large numbers of files"
    - "Cross-platform compatibility is maintained"
  
  edge_cases:
    - "Very large directories with thousands of files"
    - "Rapid file changes (multiple changes per second)"
    - "Network-mounted file systems with latency"
    - "Permission changes during watching"
    - "File system full or out of space scenarios"
    - "Concurrent access from multiple processes"
    - "Temporary files and editor swap files"
  
  assumptions:
    - "File system supports inotify or equivalent watching"
    - "Sufficient permissions exist for directory access"
    - "File system has stable performance characteristics"
    - "YAML files are text-based and not binary"
  
  readiness: "draft"
  open_questions:
    - "Should we implement file change batching for rapid changes?"
    - "How should we handle network file system disconnections?"
    - "What level of file filtering should be configurable?"
    - "Should we implement watch directory rotation for very large file sets?"
