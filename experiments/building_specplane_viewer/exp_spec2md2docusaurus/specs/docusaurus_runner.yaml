validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All required dependencies are detected and reported clearly"
    - "Markdown directory watching detects changes with 2-second debouncing"
    - "Docusaurus configuration is validated and errors are reported clearly"
    - "Development server starts successfully with docusaurus start"

  edge_cases:
    - "Missing or incompatible Node.js version"
    - "Package manager not available or misconfigured"
    - "Docusaurus not installed or wrong version"
    - "Configuration file syntax errors or invalid options"
    - "Port already in use by other services"
    - "Very large numbers of markdown files requiring long build times"
    - "Network connectivity issues during plugin installation"
    - "File system permission issues for watching or building"
    - "Concurrent file changes during build process"
  
  assumptions:
    - "User has basic understanding of Node.js and package managers"
    - "File system supports directory watching and file operations"
    - "Network connectivity is available for plugin installation"
    - "Sufficient disk space exists for builds and dependencies"

    - "Should we implement automatic configuration repair for common issues?"
    - "How should we handle very large markdown directories (>1000 files)?"
    - "What level of build optimization should be implemented?"
    - "Should we support custom Docusaurus themes and plugins?"
