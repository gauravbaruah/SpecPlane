constraints:
  performance:

observability:
  monitoring:

  alerting:
    critical:
      - "High conversion failure rates (>10%)"
      - "Memory usage exceeding limits"
      - "File system access errors"
    
    warning:
      - "Slow conversion performance (>3s per file)"
      - "High validation warning rates"
      - "Large file processing delays"
  
  slis:
    - "File conversion success rate: 95%"
    - "Average conversion time: <2s per file"
  
  slos:
    - "Single file conversion completes within 2 seconds"
    - "Batch conversion of 50 files completes within 3 minutes"
    - "Memory usage stays under 100MB during operations"

validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "YAML files are successfully parsed and validated against SpecPlane schema"
    - "Markdown output maintains proper directory structure"
    - "Generated markdown includes all required sections in correct order"
    - "References are properly formatted and clickable"
    - "Relationship diagrams are generated and embedded"
    - "Error handling provides clear feedback for malformed files"
    - "Warnings are documented in the generated markdown"
  
  edge_cases:
    - "YAML files with complex nested structures and circular references"
    - "Files with missing required sections or invalid schema"
    - "Very large files (>5MB) with extensive content"
    - "Files with special characters or non-UTF-8 encoding"
    - "Concurrent processing of multiple files"
    - "Files with embedded binary content or large diagrams"
  
  assumptions:
    - "Input YAML files follow SpecPlane schema conventions"
    - "File system has sufficient storage for generated markdown"
    - "YAML content is well-formed and parseable"
    - "Output directory structure can be created"
  
  readiness: "draft"
  open_questions:
    - "Should we support incremental updates or always regenerate full files?"
    - "How should we handle very large embedded diagrams or content?"
    - "What level of validation should be performed on cross-references?"
    - "Should we implement caching for frequently accessed specifications?"
