      - "CLI application startup failures"
    
    warning:
      - "Slow command processing (>200ms)"

      - "Frequent validation errors"
  
  slis:
    - "Command parsing success rate: 99%"
    - "Command execution success rate: 98%"
    - "CLI response time: <100ms"
  
  slos:
    - "Command parsing completes within 100ms"
    - "Command execution completes within 500ms"
    - "Help and version requests complete within 50ms"

validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Command-line arguments are properly parsed and validated"
    - "All supported commands are recognized and processed"
    - "Required parameters are enforced with helpful error messages"
    - "Optional flags and options are properly handled"
    - "Help text is comprehensive and user-friendly"
    - "Version information is displayed correctly"
    - "Invalid commands provide clear error guidance"
    - "Command execution orchestrates appropriate workflows"
  
  edge_cases:
    - "Invalid or malformed command-line arguments"
    - "Missing required parameters or options"
    - "Conflicting command options or flags"
    - "Very long argument strings or file paths"
    - "Special characters in arguments or file paths"
    - "Concurrent command execution attempts"
    - "Network connectivity issues for remote operations"
  
  assumptions:
    - "Command-line arguments are provided in standard format"
    - "Terminal supports standard output and error streams"
    - "File system paths are valid and accessible"
    - "Required dependencies are available for execution"
  
  readiness: "draft"
  open_questions:
    - "Should we implement command history and auto-completion?"
    - "How should we handle configuration file overrides?"
    - "What level of interactive feedback should be provided?"
    - "Should we support command chaining or pipelines?"
