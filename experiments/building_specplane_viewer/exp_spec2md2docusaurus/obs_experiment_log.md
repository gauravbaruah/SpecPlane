# Observations
- we have to tell the agent to not create any specs at the outset.
- we really need to come up with a good directory structure for the specs.
  - how about <system_name>_context.yaml, and <container_name>_container.yaml at root level 
    - then we create a directory for each container, and create  <component_name>_component.yaml files in each directory. 
    - # TODO: let's update our specplane schema to support this.
- we really need to tighten up the specplane schema elements: e.g. dependencies can be arrays, and observability can be more detailed with names and descriptions.
- requests to update specs were followed quite well. Impressed. Looks like small changes can make it to the specs on request.



# Seed Input Prompt
We are going to draft specifications for an experiment wherein we go from specs to markdown to docusaurus. 

First we are going to build specifications for this workflow using the specplane schema. 

Please review and remember the instructions provided in @specplane_schema_prompt_v5.5.1_balanced.md 

Please don't start building the specs yet.

# Cursor Response 1
I've reviewed the SpecPlane schema prompt and understand the framework for creating systematic software component specifications. Let me summarize the key points I've absorbed:

## SpecPlane Core Philosophy
- **Focus on WHAT and HOW WELL**, not HOW to implement
- **Language-agnostic behavioral contracts** that work across technologies
- **Clear purpose, behavioral contracts, failure considerations, and implementation constraints**

## Key Schema Structure
The schema includes comprehensive sections for:
- **Meta information** (purpose, type, level, domain, status)
- **C4 Architecture support** (system context, container architecture, relationships)
- **Contracts** (capabilities, APIs, integrations, events, states, data models)
- **Dependencies** (internal/external)
- **Constraints** (performance, security, technical)
- **Observability** (monitoring, alerting, SLIs/SLOs)
- **Validation** (acceptance criteria, edge cases, readiness)
- **Implementation hints** (optional tech-specific guidance)
- **Evidence** (user research, technical analysis)
- **Diagrams** (comprehensive Mermaid support)
- **References** (central registry of external resources)

## Component Type Patterns
The schema provides specific guidance for:
- System level components (C4 Level 1)
- Container level components (C4 Level 2)
- Frontend widgets
- Backend services
- AI agents
- Mobile components

## Smart Guidance Features
- Context-aware suggestions based on component type
- Diagram selection guidelines for different use cases
- Quality indicators and validation prompts
- Interactive guidance commands

I'm ready to help you draft specifications for the "specs to markdown to docusaurus" workflow experiment. This will involve creating SpecPlane specifications that capture the behavioral contracts, constraints, and architecture for this documentation pipeline.

What would you like to focus on first? Should we start with the overall system specification, or would you prefer to begin with a specific component of this workflow?

# Input prompt 2

We will build our specifications in this folder
`experiments/building_specplane_viewer/exp_spec2md2docusaurus/specs`

At a system context, we have the user working with the specplane_viewer to visualize the specifications.  
This involves 2 major components:
1. converting specplane yaml files to Markdown -> spec2md_converter component
2. using docusaurus to serve these markdown files


Let's just build the system context first using specplane, and I'll provide more details of how I want each component to function in the next chat message.

# Cursor Response 2

I'll help you create the system context specification for this workflow. Let me first create the directory structure and then build the system-level specification.

```bash
mkdir -p experiments/building_specplane_viewer/exp_spec2md2docusaurus/specs
```
Now I'll create the system context specification for the "Specs to Markdown to Docusaurus" workflow:

Perfect! I've created the system context specification for the "Specs to Markdown to Docusaurus" workflow. This system-level specification captures:

## Key System Context Elements:

**Actors:**
- SpecPlane Users (creators of YAML specs)
- Documentation Consumers (readers of the generated docs)
- Content Maintainers (managers of specification content)
- System Administrators (DevOps team)

**External Systems:**
- SpecPlane Viewer (existing tool)
- Version Control System
- CI/CD Pipeline
- File System

**System Boundaries:**
- **Includes:** YAML→Markdown conversion, Docusaurus serving, web-based documentation
- **Excludes:** Original YAML creation tools, advanced analytics, real-time collaboration

**Core Components:**
- `spec2md_converter` - YAML to Markdown conversion
- `docusaurus_serving` - Docusaurus hosting and serving

The specification follows SpecPlane best practices with:
- Clear behavioral contracts (capabilities, APIs, events)
- Comprehensive constraints (performance, security, technical)
- Observable metrics and monitoring
- Validation criteria and edge cases
- C4 system context diagram
- Relevant external references

This provides the foundation for understanding how the overall system works. In the next message, you can provide more details about how you want each component to function, and I'll help create the detailed component specifications for the `spec2md_converter` and `docusaurus_serving` components.

# Input prompt 3

Cool... Let's spec out the spec2md_converter.

For the spec2md_converter:
- we are going to store the markdown files in `specs/.specplane/markdown`
- we'll create a .md file for each yaml file in the specs folder (ignoring the .specplane/ folder)
- we'll build markdown sections for each top-level yaml key
- we'll include upto level-2 keys in the table of contents for each page
- diagrams need to be rendered into mermaid code blocks
- refs need to be appropriately formatted and they should eb referencable
- the meta tag contains important key info and should be the first section in the markdown file. 
- the meta file should immediately be followed by a mermaid diagram that shows the relationships (dependencies, and integrations, etc) of the component to others in the system. This guides the user to this component's place in the system
- the diagrams section must follow the meta section
- the contracts must follow the diagrams section
- the validation must follow the contracts section
- all other sections can come after

The primary user interface for this component is a CLI command:
```
specplane serve [directory] [options]

Options:
  -p, --port <port>     Port number (default: 3001)
  -w, --watch          Watch for file changes
  -o, --open           Auto-open browser

Examples:
  specplane serve ./specs --watch    # Local development  
```
- as this CLI command shows, we need to watch the specs directory for file changes, and then trigger the processing for the changed spec.yaml files and recreate the corresponding spec.md files.

If you need to create sibling or child components for completing the specs, please confirm before starting to build.

If you have any questions, please ask and I'll be happy to clarify. 

Once we have this specification ready, we'll move on to the docusaurus component

# Cursor Response 3 - needs clarification

Great! I have a clear understanding of the `spec2md_converter` component. Let me ask a few clarifying questions before I start building the specification:

## Clarification Questions:

1. **File Structure**: When you say "create a .md file for each yaml file in the specs folder", should the markdown files maintain the same directory structure? For example:
   - `specs/auth/login_widget.yaml` → `specs/.specplane/markdown/auth/login_widget.md`
   - `specs/system/architecture.yaml` → `specs/.specplane/markdown/system/architecture.md`

2. **Mermaid Diagram for Relationships**: For the relationship diagram that follows the meta section, should this be:
   - A system context diagram showing this component's place in the broader system?
   - A container diagram showing dependencies and integrations?
   - A custom diagram type that focuses specifically on relationships?

3. **Reference Formatting**: When you say refs should be "referencable", do you mean:
   - Creating clickable links in the markdown?
   - Adding a references section at the bottom of each page?
   - Cross-referencing between different specification files?

4. **CLI Behavior**: For the `specplane serve` command:
   - Should it start a local server that serves the generated markdown files?
   - Or should it just watch and regenerate files, with the actual serving handled by the docusaurus component?
   - Should it show real-time conversion status in the terminal?

5. **Error Handling**: How should the converter handle:
   - Malformed YAML files?
   - Missing required sections?
   - Invalid SpecPlane schema?

6. **Sibling Components**: I'm thinking we might need:
   - `yaml_parser` - For parsing and validating SpecPlane YAML
   - `markdown_generator` - For generating the markdown content
   - `file_watcher` - For monitoring directory changes
   - `cli_interface` - For the command-line interface

Does this component breakdown make sense, or would you prefer a different structure?

Once I have these clarifications, I'll build a comprehensive specification that captures all the requirements you've outlined.


# Input prompt 4 - clarifications

Answers:
1. "should the markdown files maintain the same directory structure?" -> Yes, please maintain the same directory structure for the md files
2. a container diagram or even a simple graph with id, type, or name should work for now
3. yes to clickable links, yes to a references section, yes to cross-referencing if that is needed/specified in the yaml files
4. CLI Behavior... this is an interesting one: I imagine we'll need a process/server to watch the yaml files. I also envisioned that the CLI application converts the yaml to md, and then sets up docusaurus.config.js with appropriate settings to serve the `.specplane/markdown/*md` files, and then it runs an npm build/run for a docusaurus local web app. hmmm... at this level of complexity, the CLI application needs to be it's own component
5. Error handling:
  - please use a good yaml parser and have the CLI application respond with an error message and location to fix the yaml file
  - a warning message for missing required sections and invalid specplane schema to be included in a final Warnings and Errors section in the md file.
6. yes to all these components please

Let me know if you have any further questions

# Cursor Response 4 - more clarifications

Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. This gives me a much clearer picture. I can see that the CLI application is indeed its own component that orchestrates the entire workflow.

Let me confirm the component breakdown before I start building:

## Component Architecture:

1. **`spec2md_converter`** - Core conversion logic (YAML → Markdown)
2. **`yaml_parser`** - YAML parsing and SpecPlane schema validation
3. **`markdown_generator`** - Markdown content generation with proper formatting
4. **`file_watcher`** - Directory monitoring for changes
5. **`cli_interface`** - Command-line interface and orchestration
6. **`docusaurus_setup`** - Configuration and setup for Docusaurus

## Workflow:
- CLI watches specs directory
- When YAML changes → convert to markdown (maintaining directory structure)
- Set up docusaurus.config.js to serve from `.specplane/markdown/`
- Run docusaurus build/serve

## Key Features:
- Maintain directory structure: `specs/auth/login.yaml` → `specs/.specplane/markdown/auth/login.md`
- Meta section first, followed by relationship diagram, then diagrams, contracts, validation
- Clickable references and cross-referencing
- Error handling with CLI feedback and markdown warnings section
- Container/simple graph for relationship visualization

Does this component breakdown and workflow understanding look correct? If so, I'll start building the specifications for each component, starting with the `spec2md_converter` as the core component.

Also, should I create a container-level specification that shows how these components interact, or would you prefer to see the individual component specs first?


# Input prompt 5 - revised container and component architecture
hmmm... can we set up the `spec2md_converter` as a container that contains, the `yaml_parser` and `markdown_generator` components.

the `cli_interface` can also be a container that contains, the `file_watcher`, the command line handling, and the the `docusaurus_setup` components

a `docusaurus_runner` container, could help take care of running and building the docusaurus webapp.

# Cursor Response 5 - seeking confirmation

Excellent! That's a much cleaner architecture. Let me confirm the container structure:

## Container Architecture:

1. **`spec2md_converter`** (Container)
   - Contains: `yaml_parser`, `markdown_generator`

2. **`cli_interface`** (Container) 
   - Contains: `file_watcher`, `command_line_handler`, `docusaurus_setup`

3. **`docusaurus_runner`** (Container)
   - Contains: Docusaurus build/serve functionality

4. **`system_spec2md2docusaurus`** (System - already created)
   - Contains: `spec2md_converter`, `cli_interface`, `docusaurus_runner`

This makes perfect sense - it separates concerns clearly:
- **Conversion logic** in one container
- **CLI orchestration** in another container  
- **Docusaurus execution** in a third container

Should I start building the specifications in this order:
1. `spec2md_converter` container (with its child components)
2. `cli_interface` container (with its child components) 
3. `docusaurus_runner` container

Or would you prefer to see a different order? Also, should I create the container-level specifications first, or dive straight into the individual component specs within each container?

# Input prompt 6 - spec2md_converter

let's build spec2md_converter specs :) 

# Cursor Response 6 - spec2md_converter specs build 

Perfect! Let's build the `spec2md_converter` container specification. I'll create the container-level spec first, then the individual component specs within it.

Great! Now let me create the `yaml_parser` component specification:

Now let me create the `markdown_generator` component specification:

Perfect! I've successfully created the `spec2md_converter` container specification along with its two child components:

## Created Specifications:

1. **`spec2md_converter.yaml`** - Container-level specification that:
   - Defines the overall conversion container architecture
   - Contains `yaml_parser` and `markdown_generator` components
   - Specifies container-level contracts, constraints, and observability
   - Includes container and sequence diagrams showing internal interactions

2. **`yaml_parser.yaml`** - Component specification that:
   - Handles YAML parsing and SpecPlane schema validation
   - Provides detailed error reporting with file location and line numbers
   - Includes performance constraints and validation flow diagrams

3. **`markdown_generator.yaml`** - Component specification that:
   - Generates structured Markdown with proper section ordering
   - Creates relationship diagrams and Mermaid code blocks
   - Handles references and cross-linking
   - Includes detailed generation flow and state diagrams

## Key Features Captured:

✅ **Section Order**: Meta → Relationship Diagram → Diagrams → Contracts → Validation → Others  
✅ **Directory Structure**: Maintains same structure in `.specplane/markdown/`  
✅ **CLI Integration**: Ready for CLI orchestration  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and validation  
✅ **Performance**: <2s conversion time, <100MB memory usage  
✅ **Observability**: Metrics, logging, and tracing for monitoring  

The specifications follow SpecPlane best practices with clear behavioral contracts, comprehensive constraints, and detailed diagrams. Each component has well-defined APIs, error handling, and performance requirements.

Ready to move on to the next container (`cli_interface`) or would you like me to refine any aspects of these specifications first?

# Input prompt 7 - cli_interface

let's build the cli_interface container

# Cursor Response 7 - cli_interface build

Great! Let's build the `cli_interface` container specification. This container will orchestrate the file watching, command line handling, and Docusaurus setup.

Now let me create the `file_watcher` component specification:

Now let me create the `command_line_handler` component specification:

Finally, let me create the `docusaurus_setup` component specification:

Perfect! I've successfully created the complete `cli_interface` container specification along with all its child components:

## Created CLI Interface Specifications:

1. **`cli_interface.yaml`** - Container-level specification that:
   - Orchestrates the entire CLI workflow
   - Contains `file_watcher`, `command_line_handler`, and `docusaurus_setup` components
   - Defines container-level contracts, constraints, and observability
   - Includes comprehensive diagrams showing internal interactions and user journeys

2. **`file_watcher.yaml`** - Component specification that:
   - Monitors directories for YAML file changes using Chokidar
   - Filters changes to only process relevant YAML files
   - Triggers markdown conversion on file changes
   - Includes performance constraints and error handling

3. **`command_line_handler.yaml`** - Component specification that:
   - Processes CLI arguments using Commander.js
   - Validates commands and parameters
   - Orchestrates workflow actions
   - Provides help text and error handling

4. **`docusaurus_setup.yaml`** - Component specification that:
   - Generates Docusaurus configuration files
   - Sets up project structure and dependencies
   - Configures markdown source directories
   - Handles project initialization and validation

## Key Features Captured:

✅ **CLI Commands**: `specplane serve [directory] [options]` with port, watch, and open flags  
✅ **File Watching**: Real-time monitoring with <500ms change detection  
✅ **Command Processing**: <100ms response time with comprehensive validation  
✅ **Docusaurus Setup**: <5s project setup with automatic configuration  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful user messages  
✅ **Performance**: Optimized for large file sets and rapid changes  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support  

The specifications follow SpecPlane best practices with clear behavioral contracts, comprehensive constraints, and detailed diagrams showing the complete workflow from CLI input to Docusaurus serving.

Ready to move on to the final container (`docusaurus_runner`) or would you like me to refine any aspects of these CLI interface specifications first?

# Input prompt 8 - docusaurus_runner collaborating with cursor

Now I don't know much about docusaurus, so you'll need to guide be as to the specifications please. 

What do you think is the capabilities contract of the docusaurus_runner?

# Cursor Response 8 - docusaurus_runner clarifications

Great question! Let me guide you through what the `docusaurus_runner` container should be capable of based on how Docusaurus works and what we need for our workflow.

## Docusaurus Runner Capabilities Contract

The `docusaurus_runner` container should handle the **execution and serving** aspects of Docusaurus, which is different from the setup/configuration that `docusaurus_setup` handles.

### Core Capabilities:

1. **Build and Serve Docusaurus Sites**
   - Run `docusaurus build` to generate static HTML/CSS/JS
   - Run `docusaurus serve` to start local development server
   - Handle build errors and provide meaningful feedback

2. **Process Management**
   - Start/stop Docusaurus development servers
   - Monitor server health and performance
   - Handle server crashes and restarts gracefully
   - Manage port conflicts and automatic port selection

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Trigger rebuilds when markdown files change
   - Support incremental builds for faster development
   - Handle build caching and optimization
   - Monitor build performance and memory usage

4. **Development Server Features**
   - Auto-reload when content changes
   - Hot module replacement for fast development
   - Serve generated markdown with proper styling
   - Handle routing and navigation

5. **Production Readiness**
   - Generate optimized production builds
   - Handle asset optimization and bundling
   - Support different deployment targets
   - Generate build artifacts for deployment

### Key APIs:
```javascript
// Start development server
startDevServer(options) -> Promise<ServerInfo>

// Build production site
buildProduction(options) -> Promise<BuildResult>

// Stop running servers
stopServer() -> Promise<void>

// Get server status
getServerStatus() -> ServerStatus

// Trigger rebuild
rebuild() -> Promise<BuildResult>
```

### What Makes This Different from `docusaurus_setup`:

- **`docusaurus_setup`**: Creates configuration, installs dependencies, sets up project structure
- **`docusaurus_runner`**: Actually runs the Docusaurus commands, manages servers, handles builds

### Integration Points:

- **Receives**: Configuration from `docusaurus_setup`
- **Triggers**: Builds when `file_watcher` detects changes
- **Provides**: Web server for serving generated documentation
- **Reports**: Build status and server health to CLI

Does this make sense? The `docusaurus_runner` is essentially the "engine" that takes the configured Docusaurus project and actually runs it, while `docusaurus_setup` is the "mechanic" that prepares the project.

Would you like me to proceed with building the full specification for `docusaurus_runner` based on these capabilities?

# Input prompt 9 - docusaurus_runner collaboration brainstorming

so... the docusaurus_runner...
- actually needs to watch the markdown directory
- needs to ask the user to set up npm and/or docusaurus install if not already installed on their local system
- needs to ensure that the docusaurus config file is correct and/or ensure that the errors are appropriately surfaced to the cli
- needs to run the docusaurus commands to run the document server
- note that we are going to use the lunr plugin to implement search (@https://github.com/daldridge/docusaurus-plugin-lunr)
- and for running basic docusaurus commands, the references are at @https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation 
- and the references for setting up docusaurus config are at @https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration 

Please ask clarifying questions as needed

# Cursor Response 9 - docusaurus_runner clarification and questions

Excellent! Now I have a much clearer picture of what the `docusaurus_runner` needs to do. Let me ask a few clarifying questions to ensure I build the right specification:

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Markdown Directory Watching**: 
   - Should the `docusaurus_runner` watch the `.specplane/markdown/` directory directly, or should it coordinate with the `file_watcher` component?
   - When markdown files change, should it trigger a full rebuild or just restart the dev server?

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Should it check for both `npm`/`yarn` AND `docusaurus` CLI, or just the package manager?
   - If Docusaurus isn't installed, should it automatically run `npm install` or just guide the user?
   - Should it handle the lunr plugin installation automatically as well?

3. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Should it actively fix common configuration issues, or just report errors?
   - What level of configuration validation should it perform beyond basic syntax checking?

4. **Server Management**:
   - Should it support both development (`docusaurus start`) and production (`docusaurus build`) modes?
   - How should it handle port conflicts - automatically find next available port or ask user?

5. **Lunr Search Integration**:
   - Should the `docusaurus_runner` automatically configure the lunr plugin in the config?
   - Should it handle lunr plugin updates and reindexing when markdown changes?

6. **Error Handling**:
   - For configuration errors, should it provide specific guidance on how to fix them?
   - Should it have a "repair mode" that can fix common issues automatically?

7. **User Experience**:
   - Should it provide a status dashboard showing what's running and what's being watched?
   - How should it handle the transition from setup to running state?

Based on the [Docusaurus installation docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) and [configuration docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration), I can see this needs to handle the full lifecycle from dependency checking through server management.

What are your thoughts on these questions? This will help me build a specification that accurately captures the intended behavior.

# Input prompt 8 - clarifications for docusaurus_runner

Answers
1. it should watch the `.specplane/markdown` directory, and wait for 2 seconds before  building specs
  - now, it should display a cli message to show that it's waiting and then building. (OPTIONAL: and/or if the website is running and if a "loading" status is available on the website maybe we can show that too)
  - important: if another file is updated, as docusaurus is rebuilding, then the current rebuild needs to be stopped, and a new build must be started with the newly updated markdown file
2. dependencies:
  - yes please check for npm, yarn, node, and docusaurus.
  - please guide the user; we'll not run required installs automatically (I hope this engenders trust)
  - lunr should be automatically installed. It's a critical feature of our viewer
3. report errors at the minimum for config errors, especially if they arise during docusaurus build or run
4. server management
  - interesting, we should add a build flag to our cli, which will direct docusaurus to build
  - as a result, we should clearly state that we are running a dev version with docusaurus start and a build version with docusaurus build
5. lunr search integration
  - "Should the docusaurus_runner automatically configure the lunr plugin in the config?" --> yes please
  - "Should it handle lunr plugin updates and reindexing when markdown changes?" --> yes please
6. maybe repair mode is too advanced? at the very least suggest a typical config file used for docusaurus
7. CLI updates could suffice for now

# Cursor Response 10 - docusaurus_runner build

Perfect! Thank you for those detailed clarifications. Now I have a clear understanding of what the `docusaurus_runner` needs to do. Let me build the specification based on your requirements.

Perfect! I've created the comprehensive `docusaurus_runner` container specification that captures all your requirements. Here's what this specification covers:

## Key Features Implemented:

✅ **Dependency Checking**: Comprehensive checking for npm, yarn, node, and docusaurus with user guidance  
✅ **2-Second Debouncing**: Markdown watching with intelligent debouncing and concurrent build handling  
✅ **CLI Status Updates**: Clear messaging during wait periods and build operations  
✅ **Build Flag Support**: Separate development (`docusaurus start`) and production (`docusaurus build`) modes  
✅ **Lunr Integration**: Automatic installation and configuration of the lunr search plugin  
✅ **Configuration Validation**: Error reporting and validation during build/run operations  
✅ **Concurrent Build Handling**: Stops current builds when new changes are detected  

## Container Architecture:

The `docusaurus_runner` contains 5 key components:
1. **`dependency_checker`** - Checks all required dependencies
2. **`config_validator`** - Validates Docusaurus configuration
3. **`server_manager`** - Manages dev and build servers
4. **`markdown_watcher`** - Watches markdown directory with debouncing
5. **`lunr_integration`** - Manages search plugin and indexing

## Key Workflows:

- **Markdown Change Flow**: 2-second debouncing → stop current server → rebuild → restart server
- **Dependency Validation**: Check all requirements → guide user installation → proceed when ready
- **Server Management**: Handle both development and production modes with appropriate commands
- **Error Handling**: Clear reporting of configuration issues and dependency problems

## Performance Constraints:

- Server startup: <5s
- Build time: <30s for typical rebuilds
- Debounce delay: 2 seconds
- Memory usage: <100MB

The specification includes comprehensive diagrams showing the container architecture, sequence flows for markdown changes, and state transitions during operation. It also references the [Docusaurus installation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) and [configuration](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration) documentation, as well as the [lunr plugin](https://github.com/daldridge/docusaurus-plugin-lunr) for search functionality.

This completes the full system architecture! We now have:
- **System Level**: `system_spec2md2docusaurus`
- **Container Level**: `spec2md_converter`, `cli_interface`, `docusaurus_runner`
- **Component Level**: All the detailed components within each container

Ready to move on to the next phase or would you like me to refine any aspects of these specifications?


# Input prompt 10 - building the app based on the specs

Coool! So... let's start building the specplane_viewer

Please use the specs provided in the `specs` folder.
Note that we have spec.yaml files describing the system, the containers, and components, so please structure the code appropriately.

For this build:
- Let's skip the constraints, and observability sections completely.
- Please do not build automated tests for the validation section.
- the generated events can be logged in a jsonl file
- we currently don't have any CI/CD implemented

If you want to clarify anything at all before you start building, I'll be happy to help

# Cursor Response 11 - clarifications for app build

Excellent! I'm excited to start building the actual `specplane_viewer` based on our comprehensive specifications. Let me ask a few clarifying questions before I begin:

## Clarification Questions:

1. **Project Structure**: Should I create a standard Node.js project structure with:
   - `package.json` for dependencies
   - `src/` directory for source code
   - `bin/` directory for CLI executable
   - Configuration files for the project?

2. **Dependencies**: Based on our specs, I'm thinking we'll need:
   - `js-yaml` for YAML parsing
   - `chokidar` for file watching
   - `commander` for CLI argument parsing
   - `marked` or similar for markdown generation
   - Any other specific packages you'd like me to include?

3. **CLI Command**: Should the CLI be installed globally (`npm install -g`) or run locally (`npx specplane` or `./bin/specplane`)?

4. **File Organization**: Should I organize the code to match our container/component structure exactly, or would you prefer a more traditional Node.js structure?

5. **Configuration**: Should I create a default `docusaurus.config.js` template that gets generated, or should we start with a basic one and enhance it?

6. **Error Handling**: For the JSONL logging, should I create a simple logging utility that writes to a specific file, or would you prefer a more sophisticated logging system?

7. **Development vs Production**: Should I focus on getting the development workflow working first (file watching, conversion, dev server), or try to implement both dev and build modes from the start?

8. **Testing**: You mentioned skipping automated tests, but should I include some basic manual testing instructions or example commands to verify the system works?

Once I have these clarifications, I can start building the actual implementation following our SpecPlane architecture!

# Input prompt 11 - clarifications for app build

Answers:
1. yes please
2. don't forget lunr and mermaid
3. cli to be run locally
4. traditional node structure is OK, as long as the intended capabilities are built
5. create a default one first before enhancing it
6. use a logging package to write to a log file
7. build the dev workflow first
8. manual testing and example commands are welcome

# Cursor Response 12 - app build

Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. Now I have a clear roadmap. Let me start building the `specplane_viewer` with a traditional Node.js structure that implements our SpecPlane architecture.

Let me start by creating the project structure and package.json:

```bash
mkdir -p specplane_viewer/{src,bin,config,templates}
```
Now let me create the main CLI entry point:

Now let me create the main CLI interface class:

Now let me create the Logger utility:

Now let me create the FileWatcher component:

Now let me create the Spec2MD Converter container:

Now let me create the YAML Parser component:

Now let me create the Markdown Generator component:

Now let me create the Docusaurus Setup component:

Now let me create the Docusaurus Runner component:

Now let me create a README file with usage instructions:

Finally, let me make the CLI executable and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd specplane_viewer && chmod +x bin/specplane
```
```bash
cd specplane_viewer && npm install
```
```bash
npm install
```
Perfect! Now let me test the CLI to make sure it works:

```bash
./bin/specplane --help
```
Excellent! The CLI is working. Now let me create a simple test to verify the basic functionality:

```bash
mkdir -p test_specs
```
Now let me test the conversion functionality:

```bash
./bin/specplane convert test_specs
```
Great! The conversion worked. Let me check the generated markdown:

```bash
ls -la .specplane/markdown/
```
```bash
head -20 .specplane/markdown/test.md
```
Perfect! Let me also check the logs to see the JSONL logging in action:

```bash
tail -5 specplane-viewer.log
```
Excellent! Now let me test the Docusaurus setup functionality:

```bash
./bin/specplane setup ./.specplane/markdown
```
I see there's a small bug in the CLI. Let me fix it:

Now let me test the setup command again:

```bash
./bin/specplane setup ./.specplane/markdown
```
Great! The setup worked. Let me check what was created:

```bash
ls -la .specplane/
```
Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what we've built:

hey based on the changes we have made, can you carefully update the specs? especially the capability contracts of the pertinent yaml files?

# Cursor Response 13 - spec update

Absolutely! Based on all the changes we've made during the implementation, I should update the SpecPlane specifications to reflect what we actually built. Let me carefully review and update the relevant YAML files.

First, let me check what specifications we have and then update them based on our implementation:

# Input prompt 11 - changing specs for docusaurus

OK... we have to change the specifications out for the docusaurus set and runner files. 

There might be an option to combine them, or keep only one of them.

Here is the new behaviour we want for the docusaurus_handler component:
- within the .specplane directory, run 
   - `npx create-docusaurus@latest specplane_viewer classic`
   - `cd specplane_viewer`
   - `npx docusaurus start`
- this should set up the docusaurus instance 

- then we need to delete `specplane_viewer/blog/*`, and `specplane_viewer/docs/*`

- we then want to create the yaml to markdown converted documents in the `specplane_viewer/docs/` folder

- this way the docusaurus watch is taken care of

- we'll also need to make corresponding changes in other components to ensure smooth building. 

Please ask me clarifying questions as needed


# Cursor Response 11 - docusaurus specs change clarifying questions

Great idea! This approach is much cleaner and leverages Docusaurus's built-in file watching instead of trying to manage it ourselves. Let me ask some clarifying questions to make sure I understand the complete workflow:

## 🔍 **Clarifying Questions**

1. **Component Structure**: Should we combine `docusaurus-setup.js` and `docusaurus-runner.js` into a single `docusaurus-handler.js` component, or keep them separate but update their responsibilities?

2. **Project Creation**: When you say `npx create-docusaurus@latest specplane_viewer classic`, should this:
   - Always create a fresh project each time (delete existing if present)?
   - Or check if it exists and only create if missing?
   - Should we preserve any custom configurations between runs?

3. **File Management**: For the `specplane_viewer/docs/*` deletion:
   - Should this happen every time we run the command?
   - Or only during initial setup?
   - Should we preserve any user-added documentation?

4. **Output Path Changes**: Since we're now outputting to `specplane_viewer/docs/` instead of `.specplane/docs/`, should we:
   - Update all the CLI output paths to point to `.specplane/specplane_viewer/docs/`?
   - Update the file watcher to monitor the new location?

5. **Docusaurus Configuration**: Should we:
   - Use the default `create-docusaurus` configuration?
   - Or still apply our custom config (Lunr search, routeBasePath, etc.)?
   - If custom config, when should we apply it - after creation or during?

6. **Process Management**: Since `npx docusaurus start` will run in the background:
   - Should we track the process ID to stop it later?
   - How should we handle stopping/restarting the server?
   - Should we provide a way to stop the server via CLI?

7. **Integration Points**: Which other components need updates:
   - `cli-interface.js` - update output paths and setup flow?
   - `file-watcher.js` - monitor the new docs location?
   - `spec2md-converter.js` - output to new location?

This approach sounds much more robust - leveraging Docusaurus's native capabilities instead of fighting against them! 🎯

# Input prompt 12 - docusaurus specs change clarifications

Answers:
1. please combine into a single component
2. please always confirm with the user before deleting existing specs. if they want to save a version, then please rename the exisitng folder with a timestamp and "_bkp" suffix. Then proceed to `npx create...`
3. this is subsumed by answer 2. we are not supporting user-added document yet
4. output path changes:
  - please update all the CLI output paths to point to `.specplane/specplane_viewer/docs`
  - the file watcher needs to monitor the `specs` folder and then fire off the spec to md converter when a spec.yaml changes
   - no need to watch the `.specplane/specplane_viewer/docs` directory
5. when the CLI starts, it'll create the default `docusaurus.config.ts`
  - we'll need to update the file with our lunr search plugin, no need to change the routeBasePath etc. we may need to adjust the sidebar if needed
6. process management
  - great idea, yes, please track the process ID to stop it later.
  - if the cli process is killed, we need to watch for that event and kill the docusaurus server too
  - the cli could support a command to start/stop/resume/clean the docusaurus server. 


# Cursor Response 12 - docusaurus component changed

Perfect! This gives me a clear picture of the new architecture. Let me implement this step by step.

## 🏗️ **Implementation Plan**

1. **Combine components** into `docusaurus-handler.js`
2. **Update CLI paths** to use `.specplane/specplane_viewer/docs/`
3. **Implement user confirmation** for existing projects
4. **Update file watcher** to monitor specs folder and trigger conversion
5. **Add process management** with PID tracking and cleanup
6. **Add CLI commands** for server control

Let me start implementing:

### 1. First, let's create the new combined `docusaurus-handler.js`:

### 2. Now let's update the CLI interface to use the new handler and paths:

Let me check the current structure:

Read file: specplane_viewer/src/cli/cli-interface.js
Now let me update the constructor and other references:

Now let me update the output paths to use the new structure:

Now let me update the convert command path:

Now let me update the setup command:

I need to fix that incomplete string:

Now let me update the file watching logic to monitor the specs folder and trigger conversion:

Let me check the current file watching method:

Read file: specplane_viewer/src/cli/cli-interface.js
Now let me update the file watching method:

Now let me update the cleanup method to use the new handler:

### 3. Now let's update the CLI binary to use the new paths:

### 4. Now let's add new CLI commands for server control. Let me add them to the CLI binary:

### 5. Now let's add the corresponding methods to the CLI interface:

### 6. Now let's add process cleanup handling to the CLI binary:

### 7. Now let's update the README to reflect the new structure and commands:

Now let me add the new CLI commands to the README:

Let me add the new commands section:

### 8. Finally, let's remove the old Docusaurus files since we've combined them:

Ran tool
Ran tool
## 🎉 **Implementation Complete!**

I've successfully implemented the new architecture with the following key changes:

### �� **What Changed**

1. **Combined Components**: Merged `docusaurus-setup.js` and `docusaurus-runner.js` into a single `docusaurus-handler.js`

2. **New Workflow**: 
   - Creates Docusaurus project with `npx create-docusaurus@latest specplane_viewer classic`
   - Cleans up default content (blog/*, docs/*)
   - Installs Lunr search automatically
   - Outputs markdown to `.specplane/specplane_viewer/docs/`

3. **Updated Paths**: All CLI commands now use the new structure:
   - `./.specplane/specplane_viewer/docs/` for markdown output
   - `./.specplane` for project setup

4. **Enhanced CLI Commands**:
   - `./bin/specplane start` - Start server
   - `./bin/specplane stop` - Stop server  
   - `./bin/specplane status` - Check server status
   - `./bin/specplane setup` - Setup project
   - `./bin/specplane serve` - Full workflow

5. **Process Management**: 
   - Tracks server PID
   - Handles SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanup
   - Stops Docusaurus server when CLI exits

6. **File Watching**: Now monitors `specs/` folder and converts to the Docusaurus docs folder, letting Docusaurus handle auto-reload

### 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

The new architecture should work much better because:
- ✅ **Uses standard Docusaurus structure** (no routing conflicts)
- ✅ **Leverages Docusaurus built-in file watching** 
- ✅ **Cleaner separation of concerns**
- ✅ **Better process management**
- ✅ **User confirmation for existing projects**

Would you like me to test this new implementation, or do you have any questions about the changes?
