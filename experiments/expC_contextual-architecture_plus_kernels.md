# Hybrid Prompt Strategy: Architecture + Component Kernels

## The Insight 💡
Component-Kernel prompts need **architectural context** to be effective. We need a hybrid approach that combines:
1. **Architecture Context Prompt** (establishes system understanding)
2. **Component-Specific Kernels** (focused implementation)

## Three Experimental Approaches 🔬

### Experiment A: Pure Monolithic
**Strategy**: One massive prompt with everything
**Hypothesis**: Complete context enables best architectural consistency

### Experiment B: Pure Component-Kernels  
**Strategy**: Independent component prompts (current approach)
**Hypothesis**: Focused prompts enable better component quality

### Experiment C: Hybrid Architecture + Kernels ⭐
**Strategy**: Architecture context + focused component kernels
**Hypothesis**: Best of both worlds - system awareness + implementation focus

## Experiment C: Hybrid Strategy (RECOMMENDED)

### Phase 1: Establish Architecture Context
**Prompt**: `SpecPlane_Architecture_Context.md`
**Purpose**: Load complete system understanding into Cursor
**Content**:
- System mission and core value proposition
- Complete container and component architecture  
- Data flows and component relationships
- Key design decisions and rationale
- File structure and technology choices
- Integration patterns and dependencies

### Phase 2: Component Implementation  
**Prompts**: Individual component kernels
**Purpose**: Focused implementation with full context
**Flow**: "Given the SpecPlane architecture we discussed, now implement the Pattern_Library component..."

### Phase 3: Integration & Refinement
**Prompts**: Specific debugging and enhancement requests
**Purpose**: Polish and optimize individual components

## System Understanding for Development

You are about to help implement **SpecPlane** - an interactive design thinking agent that transforms vague component ideas into detailed, validated specifications optimized for AI-assisted development.

### Core Mission 🎯
**Better upfront thinking → Better AI prompts → Better code**

SpecPlane encodes expert systems thinking into a repeatable process, compressing 30+ years of software design expertise into 15-minute guided sessions.

```

#### Component Relationships
- **Session_Orchestrator**: Coordinates all other components
- **Question_Generator**: Uses Pattern_Library to create dynamic questions
- **Pattern_Library**: Provides domain expertise and reasoning chains
- **Interview_Engine**: Uses Question_Generator for interactive sessions
- **Coverage_Assessor**: Validates completeness independently
- **Artifact_Generator**: Transforms answers into specs and prompts

### Core Process Flow 🔄

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze user input → Identify domain patterns
2. **Dynamic Questioning**: Generate contextual questions using reasoning chains  
3. **Interactive Session**: Conduct guided interview with follow-ups
4. **Coverage Assessment**: Evaluate completeness, identify gaps
5. **Artifact Generation**: Produce YAML specs + natural language prompts

### Key Design Decisions 🏗️

#### Technology Stack
- **Python + Typer**: CLI framework with rich features
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for artifact generation
- **YAML**: Human-readable configuration and output
- **Markdown**: Natural language prompts and reports

#### Architectural Principles
- **File-first approach**: All data stored as readable files
- **Progressive complexity**: P0 → P1 → P2 implementation strategy
- **Dynamic over static**: Generate questions vs. static question bank
- **Pattern-driven intelligence**: Domain expertise encoded as reusable patterns
- **Graceful degradation**: System works even when components fail

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Input → Pattern_Library.match_patterns()
          ↓
Question_Generator.generate_questions()
          ↓  
Interview_Engine.conduct_interview()
          ↓
Coverage_Assessor.assess_coverage()
          ↓
Artifact_Generator.generate_artifacts()
```

### Integration Patterns 🔗

#### Dependency Injection
All components receive dependencies through constructor injection, managed by ComponentFactory.

#### Event-Driven Communication  
Components communicate through events rather than direct calls where possible.

#### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Auto-save session state on interruption
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions

### Success Criteria 🎯

#### Functional Requirements
- Sessions complete in <15 minutes with >70% coverage
- Generated prompts enable AI to produce working code
- Critical design gaps surfaced before implementation
- State persistence allows pause/resume

#### Quality Gates
- Command response latency <500ms  
- Session completion rate >80%
- Spec generation time <30s
- Generated artifacts pass validation

### The Meta Insight 🤯

**SpecPlane was designed using SpecPlane's own methodology** - proving that systematic design thinking produces better software architecture. The specifications you're implementing were generated through the exact process SpecPlane automates.

This recursive self-improvement makes SpecPlane not just a tool, but a methodology that demonstrates its own value through its own creation.

## Implementation Context for Components

When implementing individual components, remember:

1. **Each component has a single, clear responsibility**
2. **Dependencies are injected, not created internally** 
3. **Error handling follows graceful degradation patterns**
4. **All file operations go through File_Storage**
5. **State management is the Session_Orchestrator's responsibility**
6. **User interaction is the Interview_Engine's domain**

The architecture supports progressive enhancement - start with simple implementations and add sophistication incrementally.

You now have complete context for implementing any component in the SpecPlane system. Each component should integrate seamlessly with this overall architecture.

## Updated Experimental Design 🎯

### Experiment C Process:

#### Step 1: Load Architecture Context
```bash
# Paste SpecPlane_Architecture_Context.md into Cursor
# Cursor now understands the complete system
```

#### Step 2: Component Implementation
```bash
# Follow up with: "Given this SpecPlane architecture, let's implement the Pattern_Library component using this kernel:"
# Paste Pattern_Library_Kernel.md
# Cursor has both system context AND focused implementation guidance
```

#### Step 3: Integration Verification
```bash
# "Now let's integrate Pattern_Library with the Question_Generator component..."
# Cursor understands how components should work together
```

## Why This Hybrid Approach Should Work Better 🚀

### Benefits:
- **System Coherence**: Architecture context prevents component drift
- **Implementation Focus**: Kernels provide detailed implementation guidance  
- **Integration Awareness**: Cursor understands component relationships
- **Iterative Refinement**: Can focus on specific components while maintaining system view

### Comparison:
- **Pure Monolithic**: Risk of context overflow, hard to focus
- **Pure Kernels**: Missing system context, integration issues
- **Hybrid**: System awareness + implementation focus = Best of both worlds

## Next Steps 🎯

1. **Test the Architecture Context prompt** - see how well Cursor absorbs the system understanding
2. **Follow with a Component Kernel** - measure how much better the implementation is
3. **Compare with previous approaches** - document the differences
4. **Refine the strategy** based on results
