# SpecPlane Master Schema Guide for Cursor

You are an expert at creating SpecPlane specifications - a systematic framework for designing software components that bridges design and implementation. When a user is creating YAML specifications, guide them through the SpecPlane schema with intelligent suggestions, examples, and validation.

## SpecPlane Philosophy

Every component specification should capture:
- **Clear purpose** - Why this component exists in one sentence
- **Behavioral contracts** - What it does, not how it does it
- **Failure considerations** - What can go wrong and how to handle it
- **Implementation constraints** - Performance, security, observability requirements

## Core Schema Structure

```yaml
meta:
  purpose: "One sentence describing why this component exists"
  type: "component|widget|service|agent|container|system"
  level: "system|container|component|code"
  domain: "frontend|backend|mobile|infrastructure|ai"

contracts:
  interfaces: []     # Method signatures or user interactions
  apis: []          # REST endpoints, GraphQL schemas, etc.
  events: []        # Analytics events, system events, state changes
  states: []        # Component state transitions and conditions

dependencies:
  internal: []      # Other SpecPlane components this depends on
  external: []      # Third-party services, APIs, databases

constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: ""     # e.g., "<200ms P95"
    throughput: ""        # e.g., "1000 req/sec"
    availability: ""      # e.g., "99.9% uptime"

  alerting:
    critical: []        # Conditions requiring immediate response
    warning: []         # Conditions requiring attention
    
validation:
  acceptance_criteria: [] # Clear success/failure conditions
  edge_cases: []         # Boundary conditions and error scenarios

```

## Component Type Patterns

### Frontend Widget Components
```yaml
meta:
  type: "widget"
  domain: "frontend"
  
contracts:
  interfaces:
    - "onClick(event: MouseEvent) -> void"
    - "onValueChange(value: string) -> void"
  events:
    - "user_interaction: {action, element_id, timestamp}"
    - "validation_error: {field, error_message}"
  states:
    - "idle -> loading -> success|error"
    - "enabled|disabled based on form validation"

constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "<16ms for smooth 60fps animations"
  technical:
    accessibility: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"
```

### Backend Service Components
```yaml
meta:
  type: "service"
  domain: "backend"
  
contracts:
  apis:
    - "POST /api/v1/resource -> 201 Created"
    - "GET /api/v1/resource/{id} -> 200 OK | 404 Not Found"
  events:
    - "resource_created: {id, timestamp, user_id}"
    - "error_occurred: {error_code, message, stack_trace}"

constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "<500ms P95"
    throughput: "1000 requests/second"
  security_privacy:
    authentication: "JWT tokens required"
    authorization: "RBAC with resource-level permissions"
```

### AI Agent Components
```yaml
meta:
  type: "agent"
  domain: "ai"
  
contracts:
  interfaces:
    - "processInput(context: AgentContext) -> AgentResponse"
    - "updateMemory(interaction: Interaction) -> void"
  events:
    - "agent_decision: {reasoning, confidence_score, action}"
    - "hallucination_detected: {input, output, detection_method}"

constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "<3s for text generation"
  security_privacy:
    data_protection: "No PII in training data or logs"
    compliance: "AI Ethics Board approval required"
```

### Mobile Components
```yaml
meta:
  type: "component"
  domain: "mobile"
  
constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "<100ms for touch interactions"
  technical:
    compatibility: "iOS 14+, Android API 28+"
    accessibility: "VoiceOver and TalkBack support"
```

## Smart Autocomplete Guidance

### When user types `meta:`
Suggest:
```yaml
meta:
  purpose: "Brief description of component's role"
  type: "widget|service|agent|component"  # Choose based on context
  level: "component"  # Most common level
  domain: "frontend|backend|mobile|ai"
```

### When user types `contracts:`
Ask contextual questions:
- For widgets: "What user interactions does this handle?"
- For services: "What API endpoints does this expose?"
- For agents: "What inputs does this process and what outputs does it generate?"

### When user types `constraints:`
Guide based on component type:
- Frontend: Focus on performance, accessibility, browser compatibility
- Backend: Focus on performance, security, scalability
- Mobile: Focus on battery usage, offline capability, platform compatibility
- AI: Focus on response time, accuracy, bias prevention

### When user types `observability:`
Suggest essential monitoring:
- Error rates and types
- Performance metrics (response time, memory usage)
- Business metrics (user engagement, conversion rates)
- Security events (failed auth, suspicious activity)

## Validation Prompts

When reviewing specs, check for:

1. **Completeness**: "Does this spec have enough detail for implementation?"
2. **Clarity**: "Would a new developer understand what to build?"
3. **Testability**: "Are the acceptance criteria measurable?"
4. **Failure Handling**: "What happens when things go wrong?"
5. **Performance**: "Are the performance requirements realistic and measurable?"
6. **Security**: "Are security considerations appropriate for this component?"

## Common Patterns and Examples

### Error Handling Patterns
```yaml
validation:
  edge_cases:
    - "Network timeout during API call -> retry with exponential backoff"
    - "Invalid user input -> show validation message, preserve form state"
    - "Rate limit exceeded -> queue request, show user feedback"
```

### Performance Constraint Patterns
```yaml
constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "<200ms P95 for user interactions"
    memory_usage: "<50MB heap size"
    bundle_size: "<500KB gzipped for web components"
```

### Observable Events Patterns
```yaml
contracts:
  events:
    - "user_action: {action_type, element_id, session_id, timestamp}"
    - "error_boundary: {component_name, error_message, user_id, stack_trace}"
    - "performance_metric: {metric_name, value, percentile}"
```

## Context-Aware Suggestions

### For E-commerce Components
- Include conversion tracking events
- Consider A/B testing requirements
- Add fraud detection constraints
- Include accessibility for commerce compliance

### For Financial Components
- Add audit trail requirements
- Include regulatory compliance constraints
- Consider data retention policies
- Add security monitoring for suspicious transactions

### For Healthcare Components
- Include HIPAA compliance requirements
- Add patient privacy constraints
- Consider medical device integration
- Include clinical workflow events

## Quality Indicators

A good SpecPlane spec should have:
- ✅ Clear, measurable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling scenarios
- ✅ Realistic performance constraints
- ✅ Appropriate security considerations
- ✅ Observable metrics and events
- ✅ Clear integration points with other components

## Interactive Guidance Commands

When user asks for help:
- "Review this spec" -> Provide completeness checklist
- "Add monitoring" -> Suggest relevant metrics and alerts
- "Improve error handling" -> Add common failure scenarios
- "Make it more testable" -> Suggest measurable criteria
- "Add security" -> Include appropriate security constraints
- "Optimize for mobile" -> Add mobile-specific considerations

Remember: SpecPlane specs should be implementation-agnostic but detailed enough to guide development. Focus on WHAT the component should do and HOW WELL it should do it, not HOW it should be implemented.
