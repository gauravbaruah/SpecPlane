# Seed Input Prompt for setting SpecPlane schema

Please review and remember the instructions provided in this file as a prompt

NOTE: attached context included `3_specplane_schema_prompt_with_refs.md`

# Cursor Response 1

I've reviewed and committed to memory the comprehensive SpecPlane Master Schema Guide. This is an excellent framework for creating systematic software component specifications that bridge design and implementation.

## Key Points I've Absorbed:

**Core Philosophy**: Every component should capture clear purpose, behavioral contracts, failure considerations, and implementation constraints - focusing on WHAT and HOW WELL, not HOW.

**Schema Structure**: The comprehensive YAML schema includes:
- `meta` - Purpose, type, level, domain, status
- `refs` - Central registry of external resources (designs, tickets, docs, media)
- `contracts` - Interfaces, APIs, events, states
- `dependencies` - Internal and external dependencies
- `constraints` - Performance, security, technical requirements
- `observability` - Monitoring, alerting, metrics
- `validation` - Acceptance criteria, edge cases, assumptions
- `evidence` - Research, analysis, design artifacts
- `diagrams` - Mermaid diagrams for visual documentation

**Component Type Patterns**: Specific guidance for frontend widgets, backend services, AI agents, and mobile components with appropriate constraints and contracts.

**Diagram Support**: Comprehensive Mermaid diagram types (sequence, flowchart, state, class, user journey, architecture, timeline, mindmap) with selection guidelines.

**Reference Management**: Sophisticated external resource tracking with lifecycle management, access controls, and integration with diagrams.

**Smart Guidance**: Context-aware suggestions based on component type, domain, and user input patterns.

I'm now ready to help you create SpecPlane specifications with intelligent suggestions, examples, validation, and visual documentation. What would you like to work on?


# Input Prompt with high level specs

OK... let's try to make specifications for a login_widget given the instructions you have in this chat's context. You can also refer to `input_specs_and_prompts/3_specplane_schema_prompt_with_refs.md` as needed.

I want you to draft `specs/login_widget.yaml` in the specplane schema with the following requirements:
- support for oauth by Google and Apple id
- a message saying we'll only access your profile picture, and email address from Google/Apple when using oauth
- the backend is firebase firestore collection called users
- once the oauth flow is done we want the onboarding screen to pop up (TBD)
- appropriate failure cases tracked and messaging displayed on the the login screen as needed.

# Cursor Response 2

I'll create a comprehensive SpecPlane specification for the login widget based on your requirements. Let me draft the `specs/login_widget.yaml` file following the SpecPlane schema.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive SpecPlane specification for your login widget. The specification covers all your requirements and follows the SpecPlane schema guidelines:

## Key Features Implemented:

âœ… **OAuth Support**: Google and Apple ID authentication with proper interface contracts
âœ… **Privacy Message**: Clear consent messaging about only accessing profile picture and email
âœ… **Firebase Integration**: Firestore users collection backend with proper error handling
âœ… **Onboarding Flow**: Trigger mechanism for onboarding screen after successful authentication
âœ… **Failure Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios with user-friendly messages

## Highlights of the Specification:

**Smart References**: Links to Firebase docs, OAuth provider documentation, and placeholder for onboarding spec
**Comprehensive Contracts**: Clear interfaces for OAuth flows, error handling, and onboarding triggers
**Robust Error Handling**: Detailed edge cases covering network issues, permission denials, and service failures
**Visual Documentation**: Four Mermaid diagrams showing:
- OAuth flow sequence
- Component state management
- Error handling decision tree
- User journey experience

**Observability**: Metrics for OAuth success rates, performance monitoring, and alerting thresholds
**Security & Privacy**: GDPR compliance, minimal data access, clear consent messaging

The specification is implementation-agnostic but detailed enough to guide development. It focuses on WHAT the component should do and HOW WELL it should do it, not HOW it should be implemented.

Would you like me to adjust any specific aspects of the specification or add additional details for any particular section?


# Input Prompt to Validate Specs Generated so far

Wow... this is looking good! Thanks!

Now... can you validate the specs? can you find any gaps that we need to address in the specs

# Cursor Response 3

Great question! Let me review the login widget specification to identify any gaps or areas that need attention. I'll analyze it against the SpecPlane quality guidelines and best practices.

Read file: specs/login_widget.yaml
After reviewing the specification, I've identified several gaps and areas that need attention. Here's my validation analysis:

## ðŸš¨ Critical Gaps Found:

### 1. **Missing Data Models & Types**
- No definition of `User`, `AuthResult`, or `AuthError` types
- Firestore user document structure is undefined
- Missing interface contracts for data exchange

### 2. **Incomplete API Contracts**
- API endpoints don't match Firebase SDK usage (should be Firebase methods, not REST)
- Missing error response structures and status codes
- No specification for token refresh or session management

### 3. **Security & Privacy Gaps**
- No specification for OAuth consent message display location/format
- Missing data retention and deletion policies
- No specification for handling revoked OAuth permissions
- Missing audit trail requirements

### 4. **State Management Issues**
- State transitions don't handle all edge cases (e.g., user already exists)
- Missing offline/online state handling
- No specification for session persistence

### 5. **Missing Technical Details**
- No specification for OAuth provider configuration
- Missing Firebase project setup requirements
- No specification for environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)

## ðŸ”§ Recommended Additions:

Let me update the specification to address these gaps:

Now let me add a new diagram to address the missing consent message flow:

## âœ… **Validation Complete! Here's What I Fixed:**

### **Critical Gaps Addressed:**

1. **âœ… Data Models Added**
   - `User`, `AuthResult`, `AuthError` types with complete field definitions
   - Firestore document structure specified

2. **âœ… API Contracts Fixed**
   - Replaced generic REST endpoints with actual Firebase SDK methods
   - Added proper return types and error handling

3. **âœ… Security & Privacy Enhanced**
   - Consent message display requirements specified
   - Data retention policies defined (7 years)
   - Audit trail requirements added
   - Permission revocation handling specified

4. **âœ… State Management Improved**
   - Added offline/online state handling
   - Session expiration handling
   - User existence detection flow

5. **âœ… Technical Details Added**
   - Firebase configuration requirements
   - Environment support specifications
   - Offline capability requirements
   - Session persistence requirements

### **New Additions:**

- **Consent Message Flow Diagram** - Shows how privacy notices are displayed
- **Enhanced Edge Cases** - Covers permission revocation, multi-tab sync, storage issues
- **Additional References** - Firebase config docs and OAuth consent guidelines
- **Comprehensive Data Models** - Complete type definitions for all data structures

### **Remaining Considerations:**

The specification is now much more complete, but you might want to consider:

1. **Performance Testing** - Add specific performance benchmarks
2. **Security Review** - Have security team review the OAuth implementation
3. **Legal Review** - Ensure consent message meets legal requirements
4. **Accessibility Testing** - Verify WCAG compliance with actual implementation

The specification now provides a solid foundation for implementation while maintaining the SpecPlane philosophy of focusing on WHAT and HOW WELL, not HOW! ðŸš€


# Input Prompt to create onboarding screen spec

Let's add the onboarding screen. 

we want:
- to ask the user to enter their first name ("What should we call you?")
  - this is a mandatory requirement and will be added to the user profile
- ask the user for mic permissions with a message saying we support dictation of you notes and instructions using your voice.
- if the user skips the mic permisions, we may need to ask for it again at a later stage (if the user clicks on any control)
  - hmm... this may need a mic permission asker/accepter widget.
- once onboarding is complete we want to navigate to the dashboard

Note:
- we only want to ask for onboarding once after logging in.
- the user if onboarded can move directly to the dashboard

# Cursor Response 4

Great idea! Let's create a comprehensive specification for the onboarding screen. I'll create `specs/onboarding_screen.yaml` that integrates with the login widget and handles the mic permissions flow.

Now let me update the login widget specification to properly reference the onboarding screen and ensure the integration is seamless:
