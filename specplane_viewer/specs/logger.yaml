  alerting:
    critical:
      - "Logging system failures"
      - "High log writing error rates"
      - "Log file system full or permission issues"
    
    warning:
      - "Slow log writing performance (>5ms)"
      - "Large log file sizes (>100MB)"
      - "High memory usage during logging"
  
  slis:
    - "Log entry writing success rate: 99.9%"
    - "Average log writing time: <1ms"
  
  slos:
    - "Single log entry writes within 1ms"
    - "Log file rotation completes within 100ms"
    - "Memory usage stays under 5MB during operations"

validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All log levels are properly supported and formatted"
    - "JSONL output format is valid and machine-readable"
    - "Timestamps are accurate and consistent"
    - "Component identification is properly tracked"
    - "Log file rotation works correctly"
    - "Performance meets specified timing requirements"
    - "Memory usage stays within defined limits"
  
  edge_cases:
    - "Very long log messages (>10KB)"
    - "High-frequency logging (>1000 entries/second)"
    - "Log file system full or out of space"
    - "Concurrent logging from multiple components"
    - "Special characters and non-ASCII content in messages"
    - "Component names with special characters"
  
  assumptions:
    - "File system has sufficient storage for log files"
    - "Console output is available and functional"
    - "Date/time utilities provide accurate timestamps"
    - "Component names are valid and consistent"
  
  readiness: "implemented"
  open_questions:
    - "Should we implement log compression for archived files?"
    - "How should we handle very large log files (>1GB)?"
    - "What level of log filtering and search should be supported?"
