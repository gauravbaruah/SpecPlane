validation:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "SpecPlane YAML files are successfully converted to well-formatted Markdown"
    - "Generated markdown renders correctly in Docusaurus with proper navigation"
    - "Documentation site is accessible and responsive across different devices"
    - "Conversion process handles edge cases and malformed YAML gracefully"

    - "Should we support incremental updates or always regenerate full site?"
    - "What level of customization should be allowed for Docusaurus themes?"
    - "How should we handle specification file dependencies and relationships?"
    - "What backup and rollback strategies are needed for the documentation site?"
    - "Should we implement search functionality beyond Docusaurus defaults?"
